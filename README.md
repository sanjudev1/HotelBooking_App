## UI Design Selection

- Finalize UI design for the booking app.

## Basic Features

- Forms for user input
- Display available rooms and services
- Navigation for specific pages
- Carousel to showcase popular room services on the homepage
- Modal interaction for successful form submission

## Packages Required

- `react-slick` for Carousel ([docs](https://react-slick.neostack.com/docs/example/simple-slider))
- `react-hook-form` for Form Validations ([docs](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#Quickstart)) ([Justification: `formik` is heavier than `react-hook-form`])
- `react-router-dom` for navigation ([docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router))
- `font-awesome-icons`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `react-phone-number-input` ([docs](https://catamphetamine.gitlab.io/react-phone-number-input/))

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Setup React App with Vite Scaffold**
   - Vite setup is faster than a basic Create React App.

2. **Tailwind Configuration**
   - Configure Tailwind CSS ([docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)).

3. **Desktop-First Approach**
   - Start with the desktop design and later adapt for other devices.

## Home Page

  - Include navigation items like Home, About, Services, Contact.
